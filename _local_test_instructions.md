As a reminder, here is how to test changes to the site by running it locally:
1. Open up the terminal/git bash to root folder of the repository (this folder)
2. Run "jekyll serve"
    2.1. If run "jekyll serve --watch --drafts" instead, you can run the site
        with draft posts displaying as if they were live posts to see how they
        would show up as you write.
3. Go to the page "http://127.0.0.1:4000/" in your browser of choice

From there, you should be up and running. As a reminder, you can close out of
the program in the terminal to restart the webpage using ctrl+c, or whatever
the mac equivalent is.  

Enjoy working on the blog from there~
