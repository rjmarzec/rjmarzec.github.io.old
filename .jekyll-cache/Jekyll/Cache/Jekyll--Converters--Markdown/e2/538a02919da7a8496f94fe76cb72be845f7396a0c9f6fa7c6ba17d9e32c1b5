I"‚<p>Hi there! In this blog post, Iâ€™m going to discuss the different resources champions in League of Legends and what those resources mean for their gameplay. It doesnâ€™t sound the most exciting on the surface, but bare with me and hopefully I can turn it into something special.</p>

<p>So, for some ground work, what is LoL, and what do I mean by resources? By LoL, I mean the titan of online gaming that is the MOBA <a href="leagueoflegends.com">League of Legends</a>.
