I"@<p>I’m Robert Marzec, and this is my website. For now, here you can find a bit
about me, some write-ups on projects I’ve done, and some of my thoughts on
game design decisions I find interesting.</p>

<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

<p>I’m a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I love
making stuff, and if there is something to make with computers, I’ve probably
done it: mobile development, game development, hardware with Arduino, and even
web development with this website. If you’re looking for a fun software
developer who likes to share their mind from time to time, you’ve come to the
right person’s website.</p>

<p>And now, a fun picture of me with some wings and a smoothie:</p>

<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>

<p>While this is my website, I’m not the one to thank for it all since I didn’t
build it all from the ground up. So, I would like to say thanks to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHubs Pages</a>, the website’s host</li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the language used to build the
website</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">Jekyll Now</a>, which was the starting
point for my work on this website</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="contact-me">Contact Me</h3>

<p>If anything looks interesting, let me know! You can reach me <a href="mailto:robertmarzecj@gmail.com">robertmarzecj@gmail.com</a>, the comment sections of most posts, or at the pages in the icons below. I would love to talk about anything. :)</p>
