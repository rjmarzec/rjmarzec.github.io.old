I"õ<p>Hi there! In this blog post, Iâ€™m going to discuss the different resources champions in League of Legends and what those resources mean for their gameplay. It doesnâ€™t sound the most exciting on the surface, but bare with me and hopefully I can turn it into something special.</p>

<p>So, for some ground work, what is LoL, and what do I mean by resources? By LoL, I mean the titan of online gaming that is the MOBA <a href="leagueoflegends.com">League of Legends</a>. If youâ€™re not living under a rock, youâ€™ve probably heard about it to some capacity. In short, a game where 2 teams of 5 players fight back and forth to tear down each otherâ€™s base by playing a character/champion of their choice to pilot their team to victory. Each champion has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, which gives the game its complexity. Among those differences you have the resources each character uses, by which I mean the cost each character has to pay to use their abilities.</p>

<p>We can separate these resources into 3 main, distinct categories: mana, energy, and resourceless. One by one, lets dive into each and explain what makes them special.</p>

<h3 id="mana">Mana</h3>

<p>First off, we have mana. You can think of mana as the default resource on champions, because it is by far and away the most popular, and for good reason. Mana can be described as a resource pool for abilities that has a high cap but low natural regeneration. In practice, this means that while characters with mana are able to spam their abilities if they so desire, they canâ€™t sustain that spamming for an extended period of time, as one they deplete their mana pool, they have to look for some external way to get it back, which usually means leaving your current fight and returning to your base.</p>

<p>While I donâ€™t make it sound all too great here, mana makes it very nice to balance characters around playing in a very specific way in fights while not being too oppressive in the longer laning phase of the game. The jump to that thought is a bit much, so let me break it down. When designing fun characters, the best place to start is to have their kit be fun when used in teamfights, because a champion that fails to have a good role in fights will likely fall flat and wonâ€™t be terribly fun. The important thing to note about teamfights is that they usually end up being short-medium length fights, which just so happens to be the ideal case for mana users. If a mana user comes into a teamfight with their full mana pool, theyâ€™re in a position to use their abilities to maximize their value in terms of damage or support without having to worry about ability costs, since once the fight ends they likely wonâ€™t need to use them again for a while afterwards. Spamming abilities is what the flow of most champions is built around, so having a champion with mana lets them play the way they were intended to in teamfights.</p>

<p>As fun as spamming in teamfights is, it can become very problematic for balancing in the laning phase. For example, we probably donâ€™t want a character like Ziggs to be able to spam his waveclear abilities off cooldown starting from level 1 because that would mean he would be incredibly oppressive and unfun to play against early on, so we have mana to counteract this. Because the cost of having to get all your mana back is so high (it means missing out on gold from killing minions, exp from said minions, and opening up your opponent to do anything without pressure from you), Ziggs, or really any champion, ends up having to play around their mana costs early on and be more strategic beyond spamming to not hurt themselves. Instead, mana champions become much weaker than they could otherwise be going all out in a fight, putting them into a place where they arenâ€™t terribly broken while having moments of high intensity in their play patterns. If necessary, ability costs, passive mana regeneration, and maximum mana can all be fine tuned in order to further pull apart the power of champions to put them in a balanced state.</p>

<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>

<p>Next up, we have energy, the resource reserved for a grand total of just 5 champions (Akali, Kennen, Lee Sin, Shen, and Zed). Whatâ€™s interesting is that energy is sort of the opposite of mana in some ways. Where mana champions usually have a large base mana pool, energy champions have a relatively small energy pool to work with. However, while mana champions usually have very low mana regeneration, energy champions have very high energy regeneration.</p>
