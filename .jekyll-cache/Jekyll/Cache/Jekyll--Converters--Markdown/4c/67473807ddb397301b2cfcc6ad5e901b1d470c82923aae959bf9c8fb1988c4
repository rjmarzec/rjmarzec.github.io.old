I"µ><p>Hey there! In this post I‚Äôll be writing about some interesting approaches for balancing characters to appeal to whales (high-spending players) and krill (new players) in MMOs that I‚Äôve picked up on over time. In particular, I‚Äôll be looking some examples from some MMOs I hold close to my heart, so keep reading for an interesting discussion.</p>

<p>To lay the groundwork before going further, I would like to introduce you to the Korean MMOs I‚Äôll be discussing today: <a href="https://www.dfoneople.com/">Dungeon Fighter Online (DFO)</a> and <a href="http://maplestory.nexon.net/">MapleStory</a>. They are the two MMOs I‚Äôve had the most time with, and I believe both of interesting systems in place that highlight balancing around whales and krill very elegantly, even if they aren‚Äôt exactly perfect in other ways. DFO is a 2.5D pixely MMO that plays like a fighting game that focuses on gearing up and raiding. MapleStory is a 2D pixely MMO that plays like a platformer at times with a focus on training and bossing. You shouldn‚Äôt need to know too much about either beyond a basic understanding of how MMOs generally work, so I‚Äôll leave it at that for now.</p>

<p>I‚Äôll also go ahead and explain the terms Whale and Krill here since they‚Äôll come up quite a bit in this post. A whale is a fairly popular term to describe players who put <em>lots</em> of money into the games they play, that is hundreds if not thousands of dollars on a regular basis. The term comes from the mobile gaming world where a few whales can very easily support a mobile game all on their own, which makes the description of a whale very fitting, since they stand out so much for how many there are of them. You usually don‚Äôt see the term used outside of the mobile gaming sphere for a number of reasons, I still feel like it is a good enough descriptor to look at and apply outside of that realm. One the other side of whales we have Krill, a term I made up to describe the opposite of a whale: a new player with no money investment into a game. Every game will have many krill to tend to, and since every whale in a game begins as a krill, thinking about how to care for them is very important.</p>

<h1 id="appeasing-whales">Appeasing Whales</h1>

<p>So, if whales are the big spenders in games that help keep them alive, it makes sense that we should probably appeal to them in some way to get them to invest more into the games they play and reward them for their heavy investment to keep them interested for longer. If you‚Äôre able to milk whales for their worth in a healthy game, you get see more money coming in from your game while also keeping whales happy for seeing their heavy investment putting them above other players. Granted, having an MMO be super pay-to-win it‚Äôs own issue with having some players stand way above others, but that‚Äôs an issue to talk about how to deal with another day/post. With that out of the way, let‚Äôs get into some examples of what I think is appeasing whales done right.</p>

<h3 id="night-lords-in-maplestory">Night Lords in MapleStory</h3>

<p>For our first example, let‚Äôs look to old school MapleStory. Back in the day, the Night Lord class was known as the strongest class in the game once they got geared, and part of the reason why is how their weapon of choice (the claw) is designed. To illustrate the comparison, let‚Äôs compare two level 30 weapons, the 1-handed sword Gladius and the Steel Guards claw. On the surface, the stat that immediately jumps out is the fact that the Gladius has a weapon attack stat (one of main stats that factors into your damage dealt in MapleStory) of 47 compared to the very low 18 that the steel guards has. When we factor in the 15 weapon attack boost that comes with the throwing stars Night Lords have to use, the claw jumps up to an effective 33 weapon attack for a difference of 14 weapon attack. That difference means that a Gladius user will have roughly 42% more weapon attack, which ceteris paribus would mean that the Gladius user would be doing 42% more damage. However, the story doesn‚Äôt end there.</p>

<p>Below the surface of this analysis we have the idea of weapon modifiers: each weapon type in MapleStory has a unique weapon modifier that increases your damage dealt by some factor. A 1-handed sword has a modifier of 1.2, while a claw has a modifier of 1.75. If we take these numbers back into account to our calculations from before be multiplying them from the weapon attack values earlier, we end up with effective attack values of 56.4 and 57.75 weapon attack for the 1-handed sword and claw respectively. Surprisingly, once we factor the weapon modifiers, we find that the damage coming from a 1-handed sword user versus a claw user should be about the same ceteris paribus. Saying ceteris paribus does hand-wave a lot of the details of what kinds of attacks the 1-handed sword user would use compared to a claw user, but it is a good starting point for the discussion here.</p>

<p>So if the difference between a claw and sword user ends up being so close, why bother giving them different values for weapon attack and weapon modifiers? Well, if we can give them unique values for both that brings them to the same spot, we now have some classes scale differently. Back in the, the main way to upgrade equipment was to scroll it, where you could apply some number of upgrades over a limited number of slots on gear. One important aspect of the scrolls in this case is that they give a fixed amount of stats on each use. To illustrate the point I want to make here, let‚Äôs go a bit extreme. Sure, (47)*1.2 will be roughly equal to (33)*1.75, but (47+100)*1.2 will be smaller than (33+100)*1.75, and it will continue to get smaller as the 100 increases by more and more. In other words, Night Lords will see more of an increase in their damage than a 1-handed sword user will even if they start off in a similar place, because the class is designed around letting players have their investments go further than other classes when similarly funded. With this being the case, we now have a class that whales might want to look towards because they will be the ones who are most capable of affording the upgrades to make use of that fact, and for that reason they may be more willing to stick with the game for longer if they know the money they put in can be rewarded. As a smaller footnote, we also have the fact that the claws and throwing stars that are necessary for Night Lords also are incredibly hard to come across, furthering the idea that the only people that should be playing a Night Lord are the whales that can afford the prices that the low supply demands.</p>

<h3 id="vagabonds-and-weapon-masters-in-dfo">Vagabonds and Weapon Masters in DFO</h3>

<p>That last example was a <em>bit</em> long, so let‚Äôs talk about a less involved example in DFO. In DFO, 2 whale classes that come to mind are the Vagabond and Weapon Master. The whale-ish quality of both of these classes is that they benefit from equipping 2 upgraded weapons. A Vagabond gains 10% of the power of her secondary weapon (including the power from any upgrades made to that weapon), while a Weapon Master benefits from swapping weapons back and forth in the form a small speed buff and some attacks dealing more damage when used with specific weapon types. Having 2 weapons to upgrade simultaneously in order to maximize your strength is very expensive, since weapons are already the most expensive piece of equipment to upgrade in DFO. In turn, whales that have the funds to be able to upgrade 2 weapons alongside the rest of their gear will be the players best suited for the classes, and their reward gets to be having a higher potential for damage due to having more areas to optimize, assuming they are well balanced around that fact. On top of this all, both of the classes are still playable without the big investment: a Weapon Master doesn‚Äôt need to be swapping weapons constantly in order to be dealing good damage, and a Vagabond can get away with using an un-upgraded weapon or hand-me-down as their secondary weapon since missing out on part of the potential 10% boost won‚Äôt ruin your damage.</p>

<h1 id="casting-our-net-on-krill">Casting our net on Krill</h1>

<p>Although taking care of high end players in MMOs is important for a game‚Äôs future and success, you can‚Äôt just go an forget about the Krill! After all, everywhere starts out as a krill, so if we make their starting experience as good as possible, they might be more likely to stay and might be more willing to start investing as a result. There are a couple ways to approach working for this idea, so let‚Äôs jump into some examples.</p>

<h3 id="demon-avengers-in-maplestory">Demon Avengers in MapleStory</h3>

<p>Jumping ahead to the modern version of MapleStory for the next example. The Demon Avenger is known as the most ‚Äúnoob-friendly‚Äù class because of how their kit interacts with health, and as a result we get a class that works very well as a first option for new players. To be more specific, where most classes in MapleStory get stronger from stats like Strength or Dexterity, Demon Avengers get stronger with the more max HP they have, which fundamentally changes how they interact with the game compared to other classes. So, let‚Äôs get into why the Demon Avenger is so nice to new players.</p>

<p>First off, at least early on into gearing up a character, health is a very common stat to come across. Every time they level up, Demon Avengers are able to put stat points into increasing their HP pool like every other class can with their main stats, but Demon Avengers also benefit from the natural increase in HP every character gets each level. Similarly, HP is a fairly common stat to see on un-upgraded gear from special equipment from bosses or set effects. As a result, Demon Avengers end up outdamaging similarly geared classes in the early stages of the game, which allows new players to participate in more content earlier on.</p>

<p>Second, because Demon Avengers use HP as their resource for using skills, they end up never needing to spend money on potions while training. While other classes might have to spend money on mana potions to keep up their skill casts, Demon Avengers use abilities at the cost of their health, so they only need to care about keeping up their HP. But even that isn‚Äôt true, since Demon Avengers also have a (conditional) full heal in their kit that they get to use regularly. So, this all means that Demon Avengers rarely ever need to heal using items while training, so any beginning starting off as a Demon Avenger gets to save a bunch of money that would otherwise have to go towards potion costs.</p>

<p>The third reason I‚Äôll leave off on here is that Demon Avengers are a simple class relative to the rest of the class in MapleStory. You mainly spam 1 button and press a few others when they go off cooldown while bossing and training, and that‚Äôs it at the start. Others might have you map every useable key on your keyboard for full effectiveness, but Demon Avengers leave it at just a few. For a new player, mixing up having to learn a bosses mechanics while battling for control of your character is tough, so simplifying the character side makes encounters much less frustrating as players are just getting into the game.</p>

<p>All together, Demon Avengers end up being a great option for new players because they get players to reach the fun parts of the game earlier than they could on other classes, and hopefully getting them there sooner means they stick around for longer.</p>

<h3 id="synergy-classes-in-dfo">Synergy classes in DFO</h3>

<p>In DFO, each class is assigned a specific role that describes their role in a party: DPS, Synergy, or Buffer. A DPS class is fairly simple: they‚Äôre main focus is doing damage. They might have some fun stuff on the side like being able to stun bosses or doing their damage in a weird way, but they‚Äôre focus is damage. Buffers are the must-have class alongside your damage dealers in end-game content. They‚Äôre responsible for buffing up the offensive stats of your damage dealers to crazy numbers. They increase character‚Äôs damage by what feels like ten-fold, but your capped at only benefiting from 1 buffer in your party of at most 4. So what do Synergy characters do? Well, they‚Äôre sort of a cross between the two. Synergy characters are DPS characters that are weaker pound-for-pound, but to make up for it they bring with them a buff that increases their party‚Äôs damage by 34%, regardless of how strong the character is.</p>

<p>Hopefully you already spot where I‚Äôm going with this one at this point. Let‚Äôs say I bring along a Synergy character that is so bad that they do 0 damage per second (DPS) into a party of a 2 DPS characters doing 100 DPS thanks to the buffer in the last slot of the party. Although the Synergy character does no damage on their own, by adding them into the party I‚Äôve actually increased the party‚Äôs damage by 68 DPS (2*(100*.34) = 68), even if they contribute nothing else! The thing to highlight here is that because a large part of Synergy character‚Äôs utility comes from outside of their gear, the barrier to entry for these classes for end-game content drops by a lot. Now, instead of having to min-max everywhere they can to be good enough to join raids, they can get away with slacking in some area due to lacking funds or time and still get a spot in the exciting content of the game, once again getting new players to taste the fun content earlier in an effort to see that they might want to stick around earlier.</p>

<h1 id="bringing-in-the-catch">Bringing in the catch</h1>

<p>I‚Äôve gone in depth here on a few examples of game design aimed at whales and krill, but the principles behind why these examples are good comes down to a simple explanation of reward versus effort. Whales like rewards that scale very well with high amount of effort/money put into games. Whales are the ones putting the most time and money into games, so they‚Äôre happiest to really see that time and money going somewhere that makes them feel good, so if we can give them the opportunity to see their rewards multiply because of their effort, we can both be better off.</p>

<p>At the same time, we want to make our krill happy. The simplest to get that done is to give them a strong push into our games, be it through free rewards or giving them options that make it easier for them to get involved in our games compared to others. The result is new players that give the game a better chance due to starting out on the right foot, and in doing so we might just catch some krill in our nets that would have otherwise slipped away if they didn‚Äôt see what fun lays ahead.</p>

<p>When it comes to putting these principles in action, we can‚Äôt forget that all of the examples here aren‚Äôt perfect. Night Lords in classic MapleStory are unplayable by new players because of how incredibly expensive they are to get going, and the DPS/Synergy/Buffer systems makes putting parties together incredibly bland, but they hopefully give us some ideas on how we can properly approach these decisions going forward. Just remember to always keep these ideas in the back of your head, as not realizing how different decisions could impact your whales and krill could lead to terrible outcomes for what is intended to be a good decision.</p>

<p>A much longer rambling compared to my first, but hopefully as insightful as is long. Whether the design choices I‚Äôve pointed out here were intentional or not, they give us a lot of good meat to chew on with regards to thinking about the types of players we want to appeal to. The more we deeply consider our players and their outcomes, the better our games become, and if we fail to consider them, maybe we see results we would otherwise want to avoid. Thanks for reading, and I hope you find something else interesting to click on next!<br />
