I"ñ<p>Hey there! With Riotâ€™s big decision to go in and rework <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com">League of Legend (LoL)</a>â€™s item system for the 2021 season, itâ€™s been a fun few months getting to mess around with new builds and watching balance be completely upended for the past few months weâ€™ve had the new toys to play around with. I have a lot of complaints here and there about how the system ended up and the moving parts involved, but Iâ€™ll save that rant for another time. Instead, today Iâ€™ll be taking you through some ideas the new system has got me thinking about: How can we explore the space between rigid champion roles in LoL through the design of our characters and items?</p>
