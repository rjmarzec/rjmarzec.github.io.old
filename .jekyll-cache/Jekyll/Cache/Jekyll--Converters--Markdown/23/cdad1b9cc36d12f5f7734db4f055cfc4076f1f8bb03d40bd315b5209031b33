I"­<p>Hi there! Today, we dive into my first run through making a proper mobile game by building out an answer to an interesting question: what do we get when we cross Rock-paper-scissors with Five-in-a-row? The very obvious answer is that we get Roshambomoku, the game Iâ€™ll be writing about here. If the idea at all seems interesting, come take a read and see how what I took from that original idea to build a full-on game.</p>
