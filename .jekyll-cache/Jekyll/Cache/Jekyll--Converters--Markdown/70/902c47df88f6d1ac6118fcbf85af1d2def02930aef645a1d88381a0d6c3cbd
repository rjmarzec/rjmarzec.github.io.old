I"‹<p>Hey there! With Riotâ€™s big decision to go in and rework <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com">League of Legend (LoL)</a>â€™s item system for the 2021 season, itâ€™s been a fun few months getting to mess around with new builds and watching balance be completely upended for the past few months weâ€™ve had the new toys to play around with. I have a lot of complaints here and there about how the system ended up and the moving parts involved, but Iâ€™ll save that rant for another time. Instead, today Iâ€™ll be taking you through some ideas the new system has got me thinking about: How can we explore the space between rigid champion roles in LoL through the design of our characters and items?</p>

<h3 id="the-groundwork">The groundwork</h3>

<p>To start, letâ€™s lay some groundwork. For most of LoLâ€™s history, items have primarily been segmented along the lines of different roles. If youâ€™re an AD assassin, youâ€™re got a bunch â€˜assassin itemsâ€™ to pick up that give you the raw AD and armor pen that you crave. If youâ€™re an ADC, youâ€™ll want to grab all the tailored â€˜ADC itemsâ€™ that give you some combination of AD, crit chance, and attack speed so you can keep up your high, consistent damage. If youâ€™re a tank, there are a bunch of great â€˜tank itemsâ€™ that mix health and armor/magic resist to make you nice and bulky. I could keep going with examples for mages, supports, bruisers, and others, but hopefully you see the point here.</p>

<p>There isnâ€™t anything particularly wrong here as Iâ€™ve laid it out, and honestly this system works out pretty well. One nice benefit from a system like this is that itâ€™s pretty simple while allowing for variation game to game still. If Iâ€™m a tank, I know I have a simple pool of items to choose from for what I want to build, but within that pool I have options for starting out with a some armor or magic resist with other effects that are useful early on, allowing me to adjust to my opponents instead of having a boring, static build. Maybe I decide that one game I want a sunfire cape early on to give me some useful waveclear, and in another I want the engaging utility of a turbo chemtank. A different effect on my character means I different way I play the game from there, and this leads to a ton of rich itemization strategy and refreshing gameplay. I would hope that we want a game like LoL to be engaging, so this is what we should be looking for!</p>

<p>So, get you to see my problem, consider this question: What would happen to the depth of build strategy if we didnâ€™t segment items along the lines of roles? Itâ€™s cool that mages get access to interesting tools like horizon focus and zhonyaâ€™s, but what interesting gameplay situations are we missing out on by barring them from the effects of QSS or shieldbow? Sure, ADCs are cool because they get access to unique effects from runaanâ€™s or bloodthirster if they want, but we never get to see cool interactions from an ADC using youmuuâ€™s or abyssal mask because the stats are awful for what they want to do. There are a <em>crazy</em> number of these kinds of combinations all over the place we never get to see because our items are segmented along item stats.</p>

<p>So, weâ€™ve finally arrived at where Iâ€™m at on all of this. Weâ€™ve got a ton of cool tools that different champions donâ€™t get to build because they arenâ€™t happy with the options the provide, and I think looking into how we can solve this â€˜problemâ€™ can get us to some interesting places. Letâ€™s dissect this idea some more, starting by analyzing some champions that already do manage to blur the lines thanks to their kits allowing them to make use of items from multiple roles.</p>
