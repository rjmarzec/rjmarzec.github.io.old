I"·<p>Hey there! With Riotâ€™s big decision to go in and rework <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com">League of Legend (LoL)</a>â€™s item system for the 2021 season, itâ€™s been a fun few months getting to mess around with new builds and watching balance be completely upended for the past few months weâ€™ve had the new toys to play around with. I have a lot of complaints here and there about how the system ended up and the moving parts involved, but Iâ€™ll save that rant for another time. Instead, today Iâ€™ll be taking you through some ideas the new system has got me thinking about: How can we explore the space between rigid champion roles in LoL through the design of our characters and items?</p>

<h3 id="the-groundwork">The groundwork</h3>

<p>To start, letâ€™s lay some groundwork. For most of LoLâ€™s history, items have primarily been segmented along the lines of different roles. If youâ€™re an AD assassin, youâ€™re got a bunch â€˜assassin itemsâ€™ to pick up that give you the raw AD and armor pen that you crave. If youâ€™re an ADC, youâ€™ll want to grab all the tailored â€˜ADC itemsâ€™ that give you some combination of AD, crit chance, and attack speed so you can keep up your high, consistent damage. If youâ€™re a tank, there are a bunch of great â€˜tank itemsâ€™ that mix health and armor/magic resist to make you nice and bulky. I could keep going with examples for mages, supports, bruisers, and others, but hopefully you see the point here.</p>

<p>There isnâ€™t anything particularly wrong here as Iâ€™ve laid it out, and honestly this system works out pretty well. One nice benefit from a system like this is that itâ€™s pretty simple while allowing for variation game to game still.</p>
