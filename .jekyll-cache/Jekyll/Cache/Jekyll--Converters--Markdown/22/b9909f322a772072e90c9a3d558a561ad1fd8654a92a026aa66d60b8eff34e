I"d	<p>Hey there! With Riot’s big decision to go in and rework <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com">League of Legend (LoL)</a>’s item system for the 2021 season, it’s been a fun few months getting to mess around with new builds and watching balance be completely upended for the past few months we’ve had the new toys to play around with. I have a lot of complaints here and there about how the system ended up and the moving parts involved, but I’ll save that rant for another time. Instead, today I’ll be taking you through some ideas the new system has got me thinking about: How can we explore the space between rigid champion roles in LoL through the design of our characters and items?</p>

<h3 id="the-groundwork">The groundwork</h3>

<p>To start, let’s lay some groundwork. For most of LoL’s history, items have primarily been segmented along the lines of different roles. If you’re an AD assassin, you’re got a bunch ‘assassin items’ to pick up that give you the raw AD and armor pen that you crave. If you’re an ADC, you’ll want to grab all the tailored ‘ADC items’ that give you some combination of AD, crit chance, and attack speed so you can keep up your high, consistent damage. If you’re a tank, there are a bunch of great ‘tank items’ that mix health and armor/magic resist to make you nice and bulky. I could keep going with examples for mages, supports, bruisers, and others, but hopefully you see the point here.</p>

<p>There isn’t anything particularly wrong here as I’ve laid it out, and honestly this system works out pretty well. One nice benefit from a system like this is that it’s pretty simple while allowing for variation game to game still. If I’m a tank, I know I have a simple pool of items to choose from for what I want to build, but within that pool I have options for starting out with a some armor or magic resist with other effects that are useful early on, allowing me to adjust to my opponents instead of having a boring, static build. Granted, this system got mixed up with mythic generally being the best first choice while having a bit of everything instead of specializing, but that’s a talk for later. As I described it, that system ends up being super exciting and engaging because it gets you thinking about what options you’re working with to create another layer of rich strategy which is super cool!</p>
