I"^<p>Hi there! In this blog post, I’m going to discuss the different resources champions in League of Legends and what those resources mean for their gameplay. It doesn’t sound the most exciting on the surface, but bare with me and hopefully I can turn it into something special.</p>

<p>So, for some ground work, what is LoL, and what do I mean by resources? By LoL, I mean the titan of online gaming that is the MOBA <a href="leagueoflegends.com">League of Legends</a>. If you’re not living under a rock, you’ve probably heard about it to some capacity. In short, a game where 2 teams of 5 players fight back and forth to tear down each other’s base by playing a character/champion of their choice to pilot their team to victory. Each champion has their own unique strengths and weaknesses, which gives the game its complexity. Among those differences you have the resources each character uses, by which I mean the cost each character has to pay to use their abilities.</p>

<p>We can separate these resources into 3 main, distinct categories: mana, energy, and resourceless. One by one, lets dive into each and explain what makes them special.</p>

<p>First off, we have mana. You can think of mana as the default resource on champions, because it is by far and away the most popular, and for good reason. Mana can be described as a resource pool for abilities that has a high cap but low natural regeneration. In practice, this means that while characters with mana are able to spam their abilities if they so desire, they can’t sustain that spamming for an extended period of time, as one they deplete their mana pool, they have to look for some external way to get it back, which usually means leaving your current fight and returning to your base.</p>

<p>While I don’t make it sound all too great here, mana makes it very nice to balance around fun characters.</p>
