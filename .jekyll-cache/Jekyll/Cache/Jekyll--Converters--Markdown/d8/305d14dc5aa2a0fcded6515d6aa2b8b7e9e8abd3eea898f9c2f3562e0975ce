I"Ì<p>Iâ€™m Robert Marzec, and this is my website. For now, here you can find a bit about me, some write-ups on projects Iâ€™ve done, and some of my thoughts on game design decisions I find interesting.</p>

<h3 id="resume">Resume</h3>

<p>If youâ€™re looking for my resume, look no further! You can find a regularly updated version <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1alBYkiOx_q2xEDRd-SzM7SUz-DnXOPBiaxRiLyrp83o/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. Thereâ€™s a lot more to me than my resume, so I suggest reading further and poking around some more.</p>

<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

<p><img src="assets/images/misc/about_picture.jpg" alt="Me!" /></p>

<p>Iâ€™m a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I love making stuff, and if there is something to make with computers, Iâ€™ve probably done it: mobile development, game development, hardware with Arduino, and even web development with this website. If youâ€™re looking for a fun software developer who likes to share their mind from time to time, youâ€™ve come to the right personâ€™s website.</p>

<p>The above is one of my favorite photos. Iâ€™ve got a shorts, a smoothie, some wings, and life is good.</p>

<h3 id="credits">Credits</h3>

<p>While this is my website, Iâ€™m not the one to thank for it all since I didnâ€™t build it all from the ground up. So, I would like to say thanks to:</p>

  <li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHubs Pages</a>, the websiteâ€™s host</li>
