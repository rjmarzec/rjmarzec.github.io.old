I"2:<p>Hey there! With Riot’s big decision to go in and rework <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com">League of Legend (LoL)</a>’s item system for the 2021 season, it’s been a fun few months getting to mess around with new builds and watching balance be completely upended for the past few months we’ve had the new toys to play around with. I have a lot of complaints here and there about how the system ended up and the moving parts involved, but I’ll save that rant for another time. Instead, today I’ll be taking you through some ideas the new system has got me thinking about: How can we explore the space between rigid champion roles in LoL through the design of our characters and items?</p>

<h3 id="the-groundwork">The groundwork</h3>

<p>To start, let’s lay some groundwork. For most of LoL’s history, items have primarily been segmented along the lines of different roles. If you’re an AD assassin, you’re got a bunch ‘assassin items’ to pick up that give you the raw AD and armor pen that you crave. If you’re an ADC, you’ll want to grab all the tailored ‘ADC items’ that give you some combination of AD, crit chance, and attack speed so you can keep up your high, consistent damage. If you’re a tank, there are a bunch of great ‘tank items’ that mix health and armor/magic resist to make you nice and bulky. I could keep going with examples for mages, supports, bruisers, and others, but hopefully you see the point here.</p>

<p>There isn’t anything particularly wrong here as I’ve laid it out, and honestly this system works out pretty well. One nice benefit from a system like this is that it’s pretty simple while allowing for variation game to game still. If I’m a tank, I know I have a simple pool of items to choose from for what I want to build, but within that pool I have options for starting out with a some armor or magic resist with other effects that are useful early on, allowing me to adjust to my opponents instead of having a boring, static build. Maybe I decide that one game I want a sunfire cape early on to give me some useful waveclear, and in another I want the engaging utility of a turbo chemtank. A different effect on my character means I different way I play the game from there, and this leads to a ton of rich itemization strategy and refreshing gameplay. I would hope that we want a game like LoL to be engaging, so this is what we should be looking for!</p>

<p>So, get you to see my problem, consider this question: What would happen to the depth of build strategy if we didn’t segment items along the lines of roles? It’s cool that mages get access to interesting tools like horizon focus and zhonya’s, but what interesting gameplay situations are we missing out on by barring them from the effects of QSS or shieldbow? Sure, ADCs are cool because they get access to unique effects from runaan’s or bloodthirster if they want, but we never get to see cool interactions from an ADC using youmuu’s or abyssal mask because the stats are awful for what they want to do. There are a <em>crazy</em> number of these kinds of combinations all over the place we never get to see because our items are segmented along item stats.</p>

<p>So, we’ve finally arrived at where I’m at on all of this. We’ve got a ton of cool tools that different champions don’t get to build because they aren’t happy with the options the provide, and I think looking into how we can solve this ‘problem’ can get us to some interesting places. Let’s dissect this idea some more, starting by analyzing some champions that already do manage to blur the lines thanks to their kits allowing them to make use of items from multiple roles.</p>

<h3 id="some-role-bending-champion-case-studies">Some role-bending champion case studies</h3>

<p>Let’s start with everyone’s favorite hyper-scaling late game carry: Kayle! When I think of champions that use on-hit items, my mind jumps to all sorts of AD champions. We’ve got champions like Kog’Maw, Varus, and Kai’Sa using them down in the bot lane as ADCs, but on the other side of the map we’ve got other champions like Irelia, Jax, and (formerly) Shyvana as bruisers also making great use of the items. I find this to be super cool because now we’re able to have these 2 different roles spec into a niche consistent damage using the fun strategy of attacking very quickly with different strategies. Your ADCs will be able to get out of sticky situations using QSS or opt to be even stronger tankbusters if they pick up a kraken slayer, while the bruisers will feel a lot different with access to sterak’s and death’s dance offering up a ton of defensive utility that allows the champions to feel much more different later into their builds than the ADCs.</p>

<p>Here we’ve got a cool split between different on-hit champions because of the unique options that their role’s tools allow them to have, but we only have bruisers and ADCs make use of on-hit builds. This means that we have all sorts of unique effects and item passives from the pools of mages, tanks, or assassins that will never get to combine with on-hit items to create some new strategies. <em>If only there was some sort of mage who could open up unique build paths in the game, combining on-hit items, with cool items that mages get to use…</em></p>

<p>Wait, Kayle is a great example of someone who does bridge this gap! Yes, a poorly executed joke there, but I tried my best. Anyways, I think Kayle is a great example of interesting places we reach by opening up item choices. At least early on into her builds, Kayle functions just like any other ADC, a ranged character who outputs a ton of damage by hitting lots of items and getting her damage from effects on her items rather than any raw stats. However, thanks to her great AP ratios Kayle ends up with a lot of flexibility.</p>

<p>Kog’Maw doesn’t see a much significant benefit from building AP unless he’s supported by lots of mana coming from his build and runes, so items like lich bane or zhonyas are just awful options compared to building any other traditional ADC item that offers much more useful stats alongside a different effect. However, when we look to Kayle, she does get to use those items! Zhonyas ends up being a super cool case to look at because having the options to pause a fight for 2.5 seconds really shakes up how combat ends up playing out in a lot of cases. Whereas with Kog’Maw getting on top of him means he’s done and dead, jumping a Kayle who has access to mage items means she can go golden and wait for her cooldowns and her team to prepare for the fight after. Now, we’ve opened up a unique scenario that we only see thanks to Kayle being designed as a mage and on-hit character, making her feel a lot different than the other on-hit champions in combat due to her build alone.</p>

<p>Hopefully I was able to get my point across at least somewhat there because we’ve got some more examples! Thanks to the item rework I mentioned back at the start of this point, we have no fresher examples of all this being the case with champions acting like assassins thanks to duskblade. At the time I’m writing this post, Sivir, Ezreal, and Master Yi, all champions generally known for their roles as consistent damage-dealers on teams, are most popular picking up a duskblade as their mythic item and shifting their playstyle to that of an assassin. Now, all of them want to jump into fights and chunk their opponents harder than ever before with a single q.</p>

<p>Now, while I would argue that these builds aren’t the healthiest for the game because having a champions instantly kill you and then run away while invisible isn’t the <em>most</em> fun to be on the receiving end of (even if chucking out nukes every few seconds as Sivir is incredibly fun), I won’t deny that this group does show off interesting design space. Looking at Sivir in particular, she goes from being an ADC all about teamfighting and bouncing damage around to trying to pick people off with strong poke while still having the consistent damage when a fight breaks out (just less than with other builds). On top of that, Sivir gets to make use of assassin tools that an ADC otherwise would ignore like a passive spellshield from edge of night or AOE slowing from the otherwise unpopular serylda’s grudge. Those effects really shake up how fights can play out when given to the team’s ADC instead of the AD assassins that have always been using them, which again means more spice and variety in out games which is (usually) good.</p>

<h3 id="easier-said-than-done">Easier said than done</h3>

<p>If you’re holding on so far, great! We’ve got an interesting idea here that tells us we should try to merge roles to give champions access to tools unique in their roles, but once you start thinking about it the task becomes a bit difficult. It’s hard to think of another Kayle for a different role that makes sense, and it feels like Sivir just got lucky with her kit having some hard-hitting spells that scale well off of raw stats. While I don’t have a great answer for designing champions like those 2 as elegantly as they are done, I can point to a bunch of examples where bridging roles is done intentionally and very forcibly to varying results. You thought the case study section was over? Well, we’ve got a few more coming up with some more bite-sized analysis instead this time.</p>

<p>One of my favorite examples here is going to be Pyke. His solution to bridging roles with items is real effective, but also real dirty and has sort of lost its purpose with time. To guide you to the process of how we get to Pyke, consider the fact that the reason champions generally don’t bridge roles is because they don’t like the stats other items offer. So, one drop idea here is to just convert the stats of items they don’t like into ones that they do! In the case of Pyke, he really wants lots of raw AD as an assassin, so he won’t ever touch items with HP on them since HP isn’t AD. So, let’s give Pyke a passive that converts all his bonus HP into AD! …wait they actually did that?</p>

<p>Cool! Now we have an assassin character that can pick up tank items to use their interesting effects while still feeding into his main goals of being an assassin. That’s kind of where this all ends though, as in practice we don’t really see this playing out. Way back in the past this meant that Pyke would <em>occasionally</em> pick up a dead man’s plate because it gave some movespeed on top of AD which is actually pretty useful for a picking champion, which is neat. Around his release when we didn’t have an AD option for support items, this also let him pick up the tank support item pretty happily, which gave him a nice home in the game. However, since then Pyke has been giving unique lethality scaling on his abilities that heavily push him to exclusively build assassin items. So, he’s a great example in concept, but not so much in practice.</p>

<p>In contrast, Yasuo and Yone follow a similar idea, but the results are much better. In contrast to Pyke, instead of converting a stat they don’t want into one they do, Yasuo and Yone are made to have their effectiveness with stats multiplied! Of course, I’m talking about crit chance and attack speed. In a game where most melee damage dealers are all bruisers or assassins, Yasuo and Yone sort of become melee-marksmen in some sense because they build as they do while still acting like a bruiser would. The reason this is the case is that Yasuo and Yone get 2.5 times the amount of crit chance they build from items and have their q cooldowns exclusively reduced by building attack speed, heavily incentivizing them to build like most ADCs.</p>

<p>So, in contrast to most bruisers that survive in fights because of the resists they build up, Yasuo and Yone spice up the category by surviving by cutting down their enemies before they die themselves or sustaining off of lifesteal supported by their big damage numbers. That lifestealing playstyle or high damage from a bruiser can only be seen because their design enables them to cross over roles when picking items to use each game.</p>

<p>Senna is probably my favorite example for all of this because of how well done her design in. Despite playing like an ADC that would normally want to build lots of AD, attack speed, and crit chance, because she has an awful base attack speed ratio, reduced crit damage, and a soul-collecting minigame for a passive that gives her a ton of free AD and crit chance, Senna is put into a weird position where she doesn’t actually need to build normal ADC items, which allows for a bunch of freedom in what roles she pulls from and what she can build.</p>

<p>With AP ratios scattered throughout her abilities, Senna can do pretty good picking up enchanter items to synergize with her kit’s heal and shield, giving us a support that deals consistent physical damage which has never been seen before! For a real long time, she took the fact that she didn’t need attack speed or crit chance to build assassin items, opening her up to being a more bursty ADC like Sivir is now. And finally, in the strangest twist of all, at the moment one of the most popular Senna builds has her building frostfire gauntlet to support her damage through bulkiness and utility in slows. If you told me there would be an ADC building an item for tanks consistently as their first item every game, I would think you were crazy, but somehow Senna finds a way to bridge the gap between ADCs, the characters with the most consistent damage, to tanks, the role known for how little damage it is supposed to deal. The result of all this is a character who has lots of interesting choices to make from game to game and who lets us look into what an ADC crossed with different roles looks like with regards to making use of fun items effects like an AOE slow from frostfire or team resist shredding with black cleaver.</p>

<p>As a small footnote, I’ll namedrop Ryze and Blitzcrank as other good examples without rambling on too much longer. Both of them find them building a toss between mage and tank thanks to their kits both containing abilities scaling off of mana, allowing them to make good use of items from other roles so long as it has mana. This doesn’t always result in reaching across the aisle for items from different roles, but occasionally we’ll see these two just do that to fun results.</p>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>

<p>We covered a lot of ground here, huh.</p>

<p>points to address:
-we already see similar roles of items like IE and rabadon’s + collector
-we probably dont want this type of design to be global, because then balancing is a nightmare and nothing matters</p>
