I"P<p>Hey there! With Riot’s big decision to go in and rework <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com">League of Legend (LoL)</a>’s item system for the 2021 season, it’s been a fun few months getting to mess around with new builds and watching balance be completely upended for the past few months we’ve had the new toys to play around with. I have a lot of complaints here and there about how the system ended up and the moving parts involved, but I’ll save that rant for another time. Instead, today I’ll be taking you through some ideas the new system has got me thinking about: How can we explore the space between rigid champion roles in LoL through the design of our characters and items?</p>

<h3 id="the-groundwork">The groundwork</h3>

<p>To start, let’s lay some groundwork. For most of LoL’s history, items have primarily been segmented along the lines of different roles. If you’re an AD assassin, you’re got a bunch ‘assassin items’ to pick up that give you the raw AD and armor pen that you crave. If you’re an ADC, you’ll want to grab all the tailored ‘ADC items’ that give you some combination of AD, crit chance, and attack speed so you can keep up your high, consistent damage. If you’re a tank, there are a bunch of great ‘tank items’ that mix health and armor/magic resist to make you nice and bulky.</p>
