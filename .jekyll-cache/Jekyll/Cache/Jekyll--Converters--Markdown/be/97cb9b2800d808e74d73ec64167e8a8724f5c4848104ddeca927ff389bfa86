I"7<p>Hey there! With Riot’s big decision to go in and rework <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com">League of Legend (LoL)</a>’s item system for the 2021 season, it’s been a fun few months getting to mess around with new builds and watching balance be completely upended for the past few months we’ve had the new toys to play around with. I have a lot of complaints here and there about how the system ended up and the moving parts involved, but I’ll save that rant for another time. Instead, today I’ll be taking you through some ideas the new system has got me thinking about: How can we explore the space between rigid champion roles in LoL through the design of our characters and items?</p>

<h3 id="the-groundwork">The groundwork</h3>

<p>To start, let’s lay some groundwork. For most of LoL’s history, items have primarily been segmented along the lines of different roles. If you’re an AD assassin, you’re got a bunch ‘assassin items’ to pick up that give you the raw AD and armor pen that you crave. If you’re an ADC, you’ll want to grab all the tailored ‘ADC items’ that give you some combination of AD, crit chance, and attack speed so you can keep up your high, consistent damage. If you’re a tank, there are a bunch of great ‘tank items’ that mix health and armor/magic resist to make you nice and bulky. I could keep going with examples for mages, supports, bruisers, and others, but hopefully you see the point here.</p>

<p>There isn’t anything particularly wrong here as I’ve laid it out, and honestly this system works out pretty well. One nice benefit from a system like this is that it’s pretty simple while allowing for variation game to game still. If I’m a tank, I know I have a simple pool of items to choose from for what I want to build, but within that pool I have options for starting out with a some armor or magic resist with other effects that are useful early on, allowing me to adjust to my opponents instead of having a boring, static build. Maybe I decide that one game I want a sunfire cape early on to give me some useful waveclear, and in another I want the engaging utility of a turbo chemtank. A different effect on my character means I different way I play the game from there, and this leads to a ton of rich itemization strategy and refreshing gameplay. I would hope that we want a game like LoL to be engaging, so this is what we should be looking for!</p>

<p>So, get you to see my problem, consider this question: What would happen to the depth of build strategy if we didn’t segment items along the lines of roles? It’s cool that mages get access to interesting tools like horizon focus and zhonya’s, but what interesting gameplay situations are we missing out on by barring them from the effects of QSS or shieldbow? Sure, ADCs are cool because they get access to unique effects from runaan’s or bloodthirster if they want, but we never get to see cool interactions from an ADC using youmuu’s or abyssal mask because the stats are awful for what they want to do. There are a <em>crazy</em> number of these kinds of combinations all over the place we never get to see because our items are segmented along item stats.</p>

<p>So, we’ve finally arrived at where I’m at on all of this. We’ve got a ton of cool tools that different champions don’t get to build because they aren’t happy with the options the provide, and I think looking into how we can solve this ‘problem’ can get us to some interesting places. Let’s dissect this idea some more, starting by analyzing some champions that already do manage to blur the lines thanks to their kits allowing them to make use of items from multiple roles.</p>

<h3 id="some-case-studies">Some case studies</h3>

<p>Let’s start with everyone’s favorite hyper-scaling late game carry: Kayle! When I think of champions that use on-hit items, my mind jumps to all sorts of AD champions. We’ve got champions like Kog’Maw, Varus, and Kai’Sa using them down in the bot lane as ADCs, but on the other side of the map we’ve got other champions like Irelia, Jax, and (formerly) Shyvana as bruisers also making great use of the items. I find this to be super cool because now we’re able to have these 2 different roles spec into a niche consistent damage using the fun strategy of attacking very quickly with different strategies. Your ADCs will be able to get out of sticky situations using QSS or opt to be even stronger tankbusters if they pick up a kraken slayer, while the bruisers will feel a lot different with access to sterak’s and death’s dance offering up a ton of defensive utility that allows the champions to feel much more different later into their builds than the ADCs.</p>

<p>Here we’ve got a cool split between different on-hit champions because of the unique options that their role’s tools allow them to have, but we only have bruisers and ADCs make use of on-hit builds. This means that we have all sorts of unique effects and item passives from the pools of mages, tanks, or assassins that will never get to combine with on-hit items to create some new strategies. <em>If only there was some sort of mage who could open up unique buildpaths in the game, combining on-hit items, with cool items that mages get to use…</em></p>

<p>Wait, Kayle is a great example of someone who does bridge this gap! Yes, a poorly executed joke there, but I tried my best. Anyways, I think Kayle is a great example of interesting places we reach by opening up item choices. At least early on into her builds, Kayle functions just like any other ADC, a ranged character who outputs a ton of damage by hitting lots of items and getting her damage from effects on her items rather than any raw stats. However, thanks to her great AP ratios Kayle ends up with a lot of flexibility.</p>

<p>Kog’Maw doesn’t see a much significant benefit from building AP unless he’s supported by lots of mana coming from his build and runes, so items like lich bane or zhonyas are just awful options compared to building any other traditional ADC item that offers much more useful stats alongside a different effect. However, when we look to Kayle, she does get to use those items! Zhonyas ends up being a super cool case to look at because having the options to pause a fight for 2.5 seconds really shakes up how combat ends up playing out in a lot of cases. Whereas with Kog’Maw getting on top of him means he’s done and dead, jumping a Kayle who has access to mage items means she can go golden and wait for her cooldowns and her team to prepare for the fight after. Now, we’ve opened up a unique scenario that we only see thanks to Kayle being designed as a mage and on-hit character, making her feel a lot different than the other on-hit champions in combat due to her build alone.</p>

<p>points to address:
-yasuo, pyke and senna as examples of an easy way to do this design-otherwise
-we already see similar roles of items like IE and rabadon’s
-sivir, ez, gp, and yi all use duskblade to this effect (maybe not healthy?)
-we probably dont want this type of design to be global, because then balancing is a nightmare and nothing matters</p>
