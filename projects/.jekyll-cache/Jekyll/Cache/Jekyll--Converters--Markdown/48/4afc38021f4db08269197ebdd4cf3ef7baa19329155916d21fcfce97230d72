I"L<p>Hi there! Welcome to blog 2 of 3 about my work in the University of Michigan’s game development course, EECS 494! After remaking the first dungeon of Zelda 1 with a partner last time, for this project we were let loose to build out our own cool ideas. I went for the exciting combination of a top-down shooting deckbuilder, and this blog will be a bit about the process to get there. If you’re curious how a Toaster’s Story plays into all of this, keep reading below!</p>

<p>If you’re just looking to play the game, look no further! Check it out using one of the download links below (recommended) or play in your browser. If you care more about how we got here, keep reading below.</p>

<p>So, how did we get here? Well, it all started off with a simple idea: top-down action games are fun because they can get very intense, and deck building games are super fun because well-planned strategies and a bit of luck can get you to start doing crazy things which is always the most fun. I had a huge list of games of inspiration in mind: Enter the Gungeon, One Step from Eden, Hearthstone, Teamfight Tactics, the Binding of Isaac, and Slay the Spire to name the most prominent ones. I thought games like Enter the Gungeon and the Binding of Isaac are great, but a lot of frustration in them can come from being dealt a bad hand to roll with and feeling like you lost because of it. Slay the Spire and Teamfight Tactics are both super engaging games because of the highs you can reach when everything goes just right alongside your good decision making, but given that there is little mechanical skill involved (it isn’t hard to click the card I want out of my hand), their concepts potentially have some room to grow and spice things up there. From Hearthstone I took a strong liking to the way that they handle single-player drafting, letting you pick cards from weighted buckets that you think best align with your most powerful cards. Finally, One Step From Eden is what I think a  happy marriage of the concepts of fast-paced action mixed with deckbuilding looks like, so it had the strongest influence on the idea for my game as I was building it out. It’s also a pretty underground game, so I would recommend checking it out if what you see here sounds fun!</p>

<p>With a cool idea, all I needed was a nice theme. My long time playing League of Legends took me to Twisted Fate and Xayah as character to steal ideas from: Twisted Fate for the theme of throwing cards as a fun way to make use of the literal deck of cards you were building, and Xayah for her ability to recall feathers feeling super satisfying in game. Together I had a super cool gameplay loop: you played as some master of cards throwing out cards from a magical deck of cards to harm your foes, and to get your cards back you could just command them since they are all magical anyways.</p>

<p>This sort of system offers a lot of flexibility in the ways you can get creative with effects in the game between special triggers on toss, recall, hit, recalled hit, or a wall hit causing all sorts of actions like speeding up your next attack, moving faster, making your next attack deal more damage, applying various statuses, dealing damage in an area, or having cards with modified base values to spice up an otherwise vanilla card. I was super pumped to get to work on an idea that has been stirring in my head for a while now, so a few days after finishing up that first class group project, I got to get to work!</p>

<h3 id="the-beginning">The beginning</h3>

<p>Everything has to start somewhere, and for Toaster Story its with a very plain proof-of-concept. I needed a player who could move around, a deck of cards to throw, and then some way to actually throw cards in order to be able to actually do stuff in the game. i settled on just getting movement and card throwing working first, and with so few bells and whistles it really didn’t take much to get it all going.</p>
