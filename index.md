I'm Robert Marzec, and this is my website. For now, here you can find a bit
about me, some write-ups on projects I've done, and some of my thoughts on
game design decisions I find interesting.

### About Me

I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Michigan. I love
making stuff, and if there is something to make with computers, I've probably
done it: mobile development, game development, hardware with Arduino, and even
web development with this website. If you're looking for a fun software
developer who likes to share their mind from time to time, you've come to the
right person's website.  

And now, a fun picture of me with some wings and a smoothie:

### Credits

While this is my website, I'm not the one to thank for it all since I didn't
build it all from the ground up. So, I would like to say thanks to:
- [GitHubs Pages](https://pages.github.com/), the website's host
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the language used to build the
website
- [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), which was the starting
point for my work on this website

### Contact Me

If you want to contact me for any reason, feel free to reach me at the email
below. I would be more than happy to talk about anything. Also check me out on
the platforms linked in the icons at the bottom of this page.
